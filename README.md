I have been programming for decades and currently using RUST, but I wanted to learn more Python. I accepted Microsoft Azure’s course they offered May 14th & 15th, 2024 called “EveryoneCanCode”. It was interesting but the class was very unorganized, although since I am an experienced coder, I was able to test the code and get a good version I altered to work very well in my Python on my own computer. And even though I tried mercilessly I could never get it to connect with Azure, so I canceled my Azure subscription after I could get no answers or help from anyone there. Right now, this Python script works well on my machine, but I would like to see it converted to a windows EXE to make it more useful, although I believe the script is way too complex to convert. Still, I am continuing to work on it, and that allows me to keep learning. At this point, the code will run in your Python with the line: py MyApp.py
